	<p
		>I'm a passionate and results-driven Junior Software Developer with a BSc in
		Information Technology and a strong interest in innovation and
		problem-solving. <br>Currently, I work at Adapt IT Education, where I help
		design and develop impactful software solutions that are reshaping the
		higher education sector. <br>At Adapt IT, I’ve built automation tools that
		reduce manual testing effort and improve overall development efficiency. <br>
		I’ve also had the privilege of mentoring graduate developers, guiding them
		into confident full-stack contributors. <br>My tech stack includes PostgreSQL,
		C# with Entity Framework, Angular, and Azure DevOps — and I enjoy working
		across the full development lifecycle. <br>I’m always looking for new
		challenges, meaningful projects, and ways to grow in both leadership and
		technical ability.</p
